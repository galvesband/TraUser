# Run a demo docker image #

This is not a perfect solution, but is useful because it allows
me to set a demo of the bundle pretty fast. The cons of this
approach is that the project source tree is served as a volume
to docker, which might not be ideal.

So, how does it work?

## How to ##

### Launching it ###

Set up `docker` and `docker-compose` in your system or server,
cd into this directory and do

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build -d
```

This will build a simple apache image and download an image
with `mariadb`, and then it will launch them and serve the
app from the port `8000`.

But **be careful**:

 - The database password should be changed, especially
   if the server faces internet.
 
 - The docker image has access to the source tree and
   in fact will overwrite the file
   `Tests/test-app/config/parameters.yml` to set up the
   database information. THIS WILL PROBABLY MESS UP
   THE PERMISSIONS ALL OVER THE vendor AND cache DIRs. Beware.
   
And take into account that mailing will not be available
becouse no mail service is available to the application or
the image.

### Setting it up ###

Enter in the container and add an user, install the assets, etc:

```bash
$ docker exec -it traUser-demo_tra-user_1 /bin/bash
# cd /var/www/traUser
# Tests/test-app/bin/console doctrine:schema:create
# Tests/test-app/bin/console galvesband:tra_user_bundle:addUser --super-admin username email@host.net password
# Tests/test-app/bin/console Assets:install 
# Tests/test-app/bin/console galvesband:tra_user_bundle:addUser --super-admin username email@host.net password 
```

The browse to `http://server-name:8000/admin/login` and use
the auth info from the user you just created to log in and
set up roles, groups, users, etc√©tera.
