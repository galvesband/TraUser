# Contributing to TraUserBundle #

TODO

At some point I will write a proper set of rules for contributing or whatever.
Until then, just keep in mind this few things:

 - This is not the FOS User bundle, nor it is the Sonata User bundle. Those are
   way more complex projects that try to address a really broad user case.
   Here I want to keep things as simple as possible while providing enough
   functionality to be usable in decent projects.
   
 - If you want to add something tell me before coding. Maybe I do not like it
   because it adds too much mess to the bundle
   and you end up having to choose between not using the bundle or forking
   it entirely. Or maybe I'm working in something alike that covers your needs
   or can be adapted with some effort.
   
 - Other than that, I would love to get contributions.
 
 - Just to be clear, I'm happy with people contributing to the bundle. I just 
   want to avoid wasting people's time; I am writing this thing to hit a sweet
   spot between simplicity with enough functionality and will reject pull 
   requests I'm not happy with. More so if I'm not warned or consulted before a 
   big code drop or something.
   
 - Really, I am a reasonable guy, just tell me what you want and we can probably
   work it out.
